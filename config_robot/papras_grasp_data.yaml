    # grasp_depth_resolution is the discretization distance in meter used for sampling the grasp depth value.

    # We need to know the transform from the arm IK link to the grasp point. By default we define the transform manually with
    # `tcp_to_eef_mount_transform`. Alternatively, we can set this to a frame in the robot model and compute the transform
    # automatically. this is done by setting `define_tcp_by_name: true` and providing a value for `tcp_name`.
